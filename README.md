# Quiz
Project for users to take single and multiplayer quizzes

# Project Description
The project is aimed at creating a generic application for users to take quiz from the pre-offered set of categories, either in single-player or multiplayer mode.

The project is also aimed at helping the users create a quiz of their own (say for a college quiz event etc.) by creating a quiz in either one of the pre-existing category or new custom user created category. If the user agrees to letting his questions get used by others, they get added to the general question bank.

The quiz can be taken online or the questions can be downloaded in a PDF format to be conducted in an offline mode.

The idea is to gamify the process of learning to make learning fun for students.
